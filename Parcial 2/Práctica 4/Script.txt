🎬 INTRO SCRIPT — “Who Killed Willy Wonka?”

[Soft whimsical music plays. The camera pans over a dark, rainy night in front of the Wonka Chocolate Factory. The gates creak open as a golden car pulls in.]

NARRATOR (voice-over):
Twenty-eight years ago, Charlie Bucket won the golden ticket that changed his life.
He inherited the magical factory of the one and only Willy Wonka — the man who made candy dreams come true.

But dreams... can melt.

[Flashback montage: Charlie growing older, stacks of bills piling up, newspaper headlines reading “Wonka Factory Suffers Financial Losses,” “Charlie Bucket Opens Public Shares.”]

NARRATOR:
Running a candy empire wasn’t so sweet after all.
Charlie opened the factory to investors — and in the chaos of business, one man bought back every single share.

[A gloved hand signs a document: “Property of W. Wonka.”]

NARRATOR:
Now, Willy Wonka is back.
But the golden boy has turned bitter.
And tonight, in the heart of the factory, during a “reunion celebration”… something has gone terribly wrong.

Willy Wonka is dead.
And one of his beloved golden ticket winners did it.

🧍‍♂️ CHARACTER PROFILES AND MOTIVES
🍫 Charlie Bucket

Origin:
The humble boy who once won it all. After inheriting the factory, he struggled to manage it. He tried to modernize production, but competition, lawsuits, and failed candy experiments led him into bankruptcy.

Now:
Charlie lost control when Wonka returned, buying every share. He was demoted to “Head of Quality Control” — a polite title for a useless job.

Motive:
Wonka took back his life’s work.
Charlie feels humiliated and replaced — by the man who once called him “the future.”

Possible alibi:
Claims he was in the Inventing Room “testing new formulas” during the murder.

🧁 Veruca Salt

Origin:
The spoiled heiress who demanded everything. Her family’s nut empire fell apart after environmental lawsuits and bad press from her childhood behavior at the factory.

Now:
She reinvented herself as a corporate investor — and owns a major stake in the Wonka Candy Co. board. But after Wonka’s return, he revoked her contracts and branded her products as “counterfeit.”

Motive:
Money and revenge. Wonka’s decision cost her millions — and her pride.

Possible alibi:
Claims she was in the tasting room “reviewing new luxury truffles.”

🫐 Violet Beauregarde

Origin:
Once the record-holding gum chewer turned blueberry girl. Her father’s small business never recovered from the scandal.

Now:
A fitness influencer selling detox gum and “anti-sugar” campaigns. Wonka mocked her brand publicly, calling her products “sad, flavorless abominations.”

Motive:
Her career was ruined overnight by his ridicule. She hated him for it.

Possible alibi:
Says she was “streaming a live fitness review” in the factory gym — but no recording has been found.

🍻 Augustus Gloop

Origin:
The gluttonous child who fell into the chocolate river.

Now:
He’s a famous food critic and host of a travel show — “Gloop’s Gourmet Globe.” He returned for the reunion to film a “special” about Wonka’s return.

Motive:
Wonka banned him from the chocolate river tour after catching him “sampling” from the pipes again. Augustus was furious.

Possible alibi:
Claims he was filming in the main hall with his camera crew — but the footage mysteriously got erased.

📱 Mike Teavee

Origin:
The TV-obsessed boy who got miniaturized.

Now:
A reclusive tech mogul who built the “TeaveeNet” streaming empire. He attended the reunion to pitch a “Wonka cinematic universe” deal to Willy — which was rejected harshly.

Motive:
Ego. Wonka called his idea “garbage for simple minds.” Mike never takes no for an answer.

Possible alibi:
Claims he was fixing a “security camera glitch” in the control room — which conveniently stopped recording during the time of death.

🎩 Willy Wonka

Origin:
The eccentric genius behind the world’s most magical candy.

Now:
After years of silence, he returned to reclaim his empire — older, stranger, and even more secretive than before. He said he came back to “restore the sweetness.”

But some say he was hiding something darker:
Secret experiments, unethical ingredients, and sudden employee disappearances.

Fate:
Found dead in the Chocolate River Hall. Cause of death: unknown.
All suspects were inside the factory at the time.

🏭 SCENE SETUP

Five possible murder weapons.
Five rooms of secrets.
And one truth waiting to be unwrapped.

Who killed Willy Wonka?
And what bitter secret lies at the heart of his sweet empire?
