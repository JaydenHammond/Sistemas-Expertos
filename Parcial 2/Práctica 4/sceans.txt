Scene 1 – The Night of the Reunion

[FADE IN]

A slow pan across the chocolate factory. The candy trees glisten under the glow of old brass lamps. The chocolate river flows thick and silent. Machines hum faintly, though some sputter like they’re coughing out their last drops of magic.

A gramophone plays an old tune — warped, faintly cheerful, unsettling.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

“They came from all corners of the world — five grown souls, each with a memory as sweet as it was sour. The gates had opened once more, and for one night only… the magic was alive again.”

Inside the Main Hall – The Grand Tasting Room

WILLY WONKA stands before them, older but still sharp-eyed, coat immaculate.
A long dining table stretches before him, covered in gleaming sweets and bubbling drinks.

WONKA (smiling thinly):

“My dear golden guests. You’ve all come so far… and yet, you’ve all lost something along the way. Tonight, we celebrate the dream that once made us pure — and perhaps, we find what we’ve each been missing.”

He lifts a glass of fizzing candy wine.

WONKA:

“To dreams. And to second chances.”

Everyone hesitantly raises their glass. The toast is made.

Later That Night

The guests wander the factory — each drawn to a different corner of temptation and memory.

Charlie stands by the chocolate river, lost in thought.

Augustus pokes through the machinery, muttering about “trade secrets.”

Veruca examines a golden nut-testing machine, tapping her foot impatiently.

Violet samples experimental gum, jotting notes furiously.

Mike hacks into a control terminal, eyes glowing with curiosity.

The gramophone skips, then stops. A hush falls.
A single scream echoes through the tunnels.

Scene 2 – The Discovery

Everyone rushes to the Chocolate River Chamber.
Willy Wonka lies face-down by the riverbank, his cane floating nearby, his iconic hat drifting downstream.

The once-sweet smell of cocoa has turned sharp — bitter.

Charlie (shocked):

“No… it can’t be. Mr. Wonka—”

Violet (grimly):

“He’s not breathing.”

Veruca (snapping):

“Oh, please! He’s faking it. He lives for theatrics!”

Mike:

“If it’s a trick, it’s the most convincing one yet…”

Augustus:

“Someone must have been here before us. The chocolate river — look! It’s… darker.”

The group stares in silence. In the distance, faintly, a factory whistle blows once, then dies.

NARRATOR (V.O.):

“The gates are sealed. The Oompa-Loompas have vanished. And somewhere in this maze of sugar and shadows — a killer walks among them.”
